I'm thrilled to finally announce my first app [MusicKeeper](https://musickeeper.app), a music manager app that help you manage, extract, transfer your music between different music provider and have the ambition to help you legally and easily buy the music you loves to finally own back your music locally.

## Why MusicKeeper ?

* You want to switch from a music provider to another (for example: Spotify to Apple Music ).
* You want to save your favorite music in the most compatible format it exist (simple text file, maybe more types would be available later).
* You are subscribed to many music provider and it's tedious to keep them synchronized.
* You want to support your favorites artists by buying their music in one click, and own the file legally and digitally
* You share your playlists to peoples, but it's tedious to create it on every service.
* You want to take back control on your music, own the files and why not exit from music providers.

## Price

Given the limited number of features, for the time being, the application is free and requires a simple Spotify account (other services will be arriving soon, Apple Music will be next.) in order to retrieve your playlists.

Then, when I add more features like those described above, some will be paid (I don't know what the pricing plan will look like yet).

## Open Source

I chose to build it open source, because I like to share and mutual aid a community can have. I also wanted to try [\#buildinpublic](https://buildinpublic.com).

Please think about [give a star the project on Github](https://github.com/Thomasevano/musickeeper) it will help me a lot.

## How the idea started ?

I recently realized that with the music provider subscription, we don't own anything, not only in music, but also movies, series and even video games. The worst of that is that sometimes even buying it digitally, you don't own it. We recently seen it with [movies bought on playstation store](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulls-discovery-videos-playstation-users-already-own-sparking-concern-over-our-digital-future)).

We also have seen some examples with artists that disagree with spotify and removes there music from it.

So what if tomorrow your favorite artists leaves your favorite music provider ? Or worst it close and you lose your playlists, saved albums, favorite music and you don't remember all the names cause you have your listening habits there ?

So the idea is to not depend on a service you use. So you could extract your music library out of it. And what is awesome as MusicKeeper is open-source, if it is not available online one day you could still clone it and run it locally.
You can find the progress and and ideas of features on the [Github page of the project](https://github.com/Thomasevano/musickeeper).

## Long-term ambition

Be a true hub to manage your music library. Imagine, you are a creator, curator or entreprise that create/handle playlists. You don't want to manually do it on each music provider. Why not manage your playlist from musickeeper and sync it with all the music provider you want.
Or you are just a simple music enthusiast who would like to legally buy their favorite music, digitally, own the file. Search anything in MusicKepper and it will tell you where to buy it. Imagine being able to create playlists by a genre, an artist, a time period or even everything of this at once.

Thank you so much for reading this until here. Go check and try [MusicKeeper](https://musickeeper.app) and give me feedback on any bugs or new features you had wish to see. Project is still in early alpha stage, so there can be bug I'm not aware of.
